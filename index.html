      <h1>Iterative Design</h1>
      <h2>Introduction and Summary</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, we had the opportunity to work with the startup Uno
        Health that focuses on making it easier for the elderly and others to
        get government benefits they are entitled to. We worked on redesigning
        their document upload experience for a household application (e.g., an
        individual and their spouse), and in the process made improvements to
        the homepage and eligibility check. Over the course of our redesign, we
        made sketches, made a lo-fi wireframe, and a hi-fi mockup. Iteration
        based on critique was a key component of our design process, ultimately
        allowing us to develop a prototype that best addressed the needs of
        users.

      <h2>Conclusion and Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        A key way in which we improved our soft skills relating to design was in
        our experience working as a team throughout the design process. This
        gave us a chance to deal with disagreements that come up and to work
        through design problems more explicitly, since we all had to be on the
        same page about everything. Over the course of this project, we
        developed a true understanding of the idea that “the first design is
        never the best one.” Iteration based not only on our own cognitive
        walkthroughs but also on direct feedback from others is critical, and
        the integration of that feedback is perhaps even more important than
        developing the initial design starting point.
        <br /><br />
        On the more technical side of things, we significantly improved our
        skills in Figma, including developing working prototypes that one can
        click through. We also got experience using Loom and had practice in
        making short videos that were able to concisely and clearly display our
        work. All in all, we had a great experience working on this project
        together, and look forward to continuing to develop our skills in future
        endeavors.
